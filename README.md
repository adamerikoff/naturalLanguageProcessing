## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* **Text Classification:**
    * Naive Bayes
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
    * Random Forest
    * Gradient Boosting
    * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
    * BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

* **Text Summarization:**
    * Extractive Summarization
    * Abstractive Summarization with Attention
    * Transformer-XL (for complex questions)

* **Sentiment Analysis:**
    * Lexicon-based approach
    * Machine Learning models (similar to text classification)

* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
    * Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)
    * Bidirectional LSTMs

* **Machine Translation:**
    * Encoder-Decoder models with LSTMs or Transformers

* **Other NLP Algorithms:**
    * Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
    * Natural Language Generation (NLG)
    * Chatbots
    * Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3) (for advanced chatbots)
